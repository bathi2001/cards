                    <h2>Capri, Italy</h2>
                    <p>Few parts of the world can claim such a range of natural beauty as Italy, with craggy peaks
                        and verdant hills to turquoise waters lined by white-sand beaches. But the island of Capri
                        easily numbers among the most gorgeous (and most glamorous) spots in the country.

                    <h2>Antarctica</h2>
                    <p>That’s right, we put an entire continent on here. Although 99 percent of Antarctica is
                        covered with ice, the landscape still manages to be stunningly diverse—surreal blue
                        glaciers, active volcanoes, the rough waterways of the Drake Passage, and 360-degree views
                        of untouched snow.

                    <h2>Na Pali Coast, Hawaii</h2>
                    <p>Kauai has one of the world’s most gorgeous coastlines, with towering waterfalls and isolated
                        crescent beaches. Just be prepared to put in a little effort to soak up its wonders: Na Pali
                        can only be seen from a helicopter, catamaran, or a rather grueling hike.

                    <h2>Angel Falls, Venezuela</h2>
                    <p>Venezuela overflows with natural wonders, including the world’s highest waterfall: the
                        3,212-foot cascades of Angel Falls, located in the UNESCO-protected Canaima National Park.
                        Canaima is by far the country’s most popular attraction, and the falls stretch an astounding
                        19 times higher than Niagara Falls.

                    <h2>The Azores, Portugal</h2>
                    <p>Roughly 900 miles off the coast of Lisbon, this Portuguese archipelago can inspire wanderlust
                        with a single photo. The verdant valleys, steep oceanside cliffs, rows of blue hydrangeas,
                        and scattering of waterfalls make the Azores a paradise worth exploring. Just make sure you
                        visit before everyone you know beats you to it.

                    <h2>Cliffs of Moher, Ireland</h2>
                    <p>Few places exemplify the raw, untamed beauty of Ireland’s west coast like this natural
                        wonder, which tops 702 feet at the highest point. And while you might know them better as
                        the Cliffs of Insanity from The Princess Bride, in reality, the cliffs are located just
                        south of Galway. They run for about 14 kilometres.

                    <h2>Machu Picchu, Peru</h2>
                    <p>While the intricate stone ruins of Machu Picchu are the work of 15th-century Incans, the
                        site’s natural setting makes it even more alluring. Perched atop the flattened peak of a
                        mountain, the ancient Wonder of the World benefits from the famous backdrop of Huayna
                        Picchu, lush green surfaces, and a barrier of Andean peaks that, despite the landmark’s
                        fame, makes you feel like you've stumbled upon a secret.

                    <h2>Mount Fuji, Japan</h2>
                    <p>It’s hard to pick the single most beautiful place in Japan, but 12,388-foot Mount Fuji just
                        might take the prize. Visit Lake Kawaguchiko in the spring for some of the best views of the
                        mountain and cherry blossom trees—a postcard-worthy sight if we ever saw one. Or if you’re
                        an avid hiker, plan a trip for mid-July until the end of August, when the snow melts enough
                        to allow access to Fuji’s summit.

                    <h2>The Amazon</h2>
                    <p>Covering roughly 40 percent of South America, including parts of Brazil, Peru, and Colombia,
                        the Amazon is the largest rainforest on the planet, and home to more than 40,000 plant
                        species and 1,300 bird species alone. But be sure to visit the winding rivers and diverse
                        wildlife while you can—climate change (along with man-made fires) is increasingly whittling
                        away the habitat every day.
